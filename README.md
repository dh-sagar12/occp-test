# OCPP Protocol Demo Backend

This is a simple backend application demonstrating the use of the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The backend is built using **FastAPI** and **WebSockets** to facilitate communication between the EV charging station and the backend server. The OCPP protocol enables seamless management of charging sessions, allowing real-time status updates and control of charging operations.

## Features

- **OCPP Support**: Implements OCPP 1.6 for handling communication between EV charging stations and the backend.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time communication using WebSockets for sending and receiving OCPP messages.
- **Charging Management**: Basic features to start, stop, and monitor EV charging sessions.
- **FastAPI**: Provides an efficient and high-performance backend for handling API requests and WebSocket connections.

## Installation

To set up the backend, follow the instructions below:

### 1. Clone the repository
### 2. Run the Dockerfile 
### 3. Migrate the database
